### Analysis Questions

<add answers here>

Although the Stack interface included FullStackException throw for the push method, I did not include the exception in my implementation since we are using the linked data structure and the stack never gets full. I implemented the full shunting yard algorithm given at the Wikipedia page which included handling some functions and the Pi value. On top of that, I added several more functions like sin, max, min, cos, log and sqrt. As the algorithm on Wikipedia page, my implementation of the algorithm does not handle the unary minus.

### Lab Questionnaire

(None of your answers below will affect your grade; this is to help refine lab
assignments in the future)

1. Approximately, how many hours did you take to complete this lab? (provide
  your answer as a single integer on the line below)
  20

2. How difficult did you find this lab? (1-5, with 5 being very difficult and 1
  being very easy)
  4

3. Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:
I had difficulties implementing the shunting yard algorithm at first since I did 
not completely understand which symbols would fall under the operator pattern.

4. Was the **VerifyFormat** file useful to you during testing?
Yes.

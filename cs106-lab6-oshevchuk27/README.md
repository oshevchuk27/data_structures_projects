Extra credit part

I implemented the Huffman Coding algorithm but only the one where the codes and characters are given. My HuffEncode class first encodes the message and then decodes it. My HuffDecode class decodes the message but does not encode it back. 
The result of decoding a secret file: I obtained a picture of a squirrel, a Haverford College mascot, as a result of decoding the given text file.
